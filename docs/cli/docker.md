To test the docs site, generated by Docinator, on a local machine:

1. Create `docker-compose.yml` with following content and place it at the repo top level folder

```yaml 
version: "3.8"
services:
    docinator-docs-site:
        image: registry.gitlab.com/tmobile/citadel/docinator/tmo-main:latest
        entrypoint: "docinator serve"
        working_dir: /data
        volumes:
            - type: bind
              source: ./docs
              target: /data/docs
        ports:
            - 1313:1313
```

2. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on the local machine

3. Run `docker-compose up`, this will bring the docs server up and running at `http://localhost:1313`

4. After testing is complete, Press `Ctrl+c` to stop the docs server then

5. Run `docker-compose down`
